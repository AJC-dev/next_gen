Postcard Creator app - Phase 2


1) index.html is now 1500 lines - can we split this out to leave as much of the html server side as possible?
2) There are variable elements that i'd like to separate out so these can be configured by another UI.  example: button colours, title, and subtitle, and links in subtitle, email sender name, email subject and email text.
3) Create UI to configure these elements and update the page.
4) add a database function so we can log and limit usage as required by the client.
